\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec1} The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in
    primitive variables are 
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{array}{rcl}
         \partial_t \vec{u} - \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u} +
        (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla )\vec{u} + \nabla p & =
        & \vec{f},\\
        \nabla \cdot \vec{u} & = & 0,
      \end{array}
      \label{eq::NS}
    \end{equation}
    with initial and boundary conditions on $\partial
    \Omega = \partial \Omega_D \bigcup \partial \Omega_N$:
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \vec{u} = \vec{w},& \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega_D \times [0,
        T]\\
        \nu \displaystyle \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial n} - p =
        \vec{0}, & \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega_N \times [0, T],  \\
        \vec{u}|_{t = 0} = \vec{u_0}, & \mbox{ in } \Omega. 
      \end{array}
      \label{eq::bc}
    \end{equation}    
    where $\Omega \in \mathcal{R}^d,(d = 2, 3)$ is computional domain,
    $[0,T]$ is the time interval, $\vec{u}$ is velocity and scalar $p$
    is pressure, $\vec{n}$ denotes outward normal direction of
    $\partial \Omega$, $\nu > 0$ is the constant kinematic
    viscosity.

    We solve (\ref{eq::NS}) and (\ref{eq::bc}) by moving
    mesh finite element methods based on \cite{li2001mesh} and
    \cite{di2005}. In the past, some moving mesh methods have been
    introduced. Winslow \cite{Winslow1966NUMERICAL} proposed solving
    elliptic PDEs using moving mesh. As an extension of Winslow' work,
    Dvinsky \cite{dvinsky1991adaptive} pointed out that harmonic
    function theory could be used for generating mesh. Motivated by
    Dvinsky's work, L1, Tang and Zhang \cite{li2001mesh} proposed a
    moving mesh finite element strategy based upon harmonic
    mapping. The authors in \cite{di2005moving} extended the moving
    strategy to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in
    primitive variables. The author designed a divergence-free
    interpolation in moving strategy by solving a linearized
    Navier-Stokes-type equations. In \cite{Wu2016moving}, $4P1-P1$
    element pair is applied to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes flow
    with moving mesh finite element method based on the work of
    \cite{di2005moving}. This pair has same mesh structure as
    $P1isoP2P1$ element, which is natrually LBB stable see
    \cite{bercovier1979error}. Four velocity elements can be obtained
    by refining the pressure element one time see Figure
    \ref{fig::p-v}. Linear velocity basis functions of
    $4P1-P1$ are all locally in the same velocity element, whereas
    $P1isoP2P1$ not, see \cite{Wu2016moving} for detail.

    As we known, spacial discretization of Navier-Stokes system with
    LBB-stable $4P1-P1$ element pair leads to a saddle point problem.
    There are a lot works on saddle point problems by developing
    preconditioners for Krylov subspace method, such as block
    preconditioner and multigrid strategy. Readers can refer to
    \cite{benzi2005numerical} for detail. Many works(\cite{shen1999schur},
    \cite{bai2005inexact}, \cite{bai2006structured},
    \cite{elman2007least},\cite{elman2009boundary}) introduce a
    variety of block preconditioners, whose main issue are finding a
    good approximation of schur complement. Also there are other
    precondition methods, for instance (\cite{benzi2006augmented},
    \cite{benzi2011relaxed}). The authors in (\cite{boyle2007hsl}
    \cite{boyle2010hsl_mi20}) propose an efficient AMG preconditioner
    for Krylov solver to solve Navier-Stokes equations. However,
    efficient precondition methods for saddle point problems are nearlly
    based on uniform mesh (although the stretched mesh case is considered
    in \cite{benzi2011relaxed}).
    
    In this work, we apply an AMG preconditioner to moving mesh
    finite element for solving systems (\ref{eq::NS}) and
    (\ref{eq::bc}) based on the work of
    \cite{elman2005finite}. Also AMG precondition stretegy is designed
    for divergence-free interpolation in moving mesh
    method. Efficiency of the AMG preconditioner is analyzed througth
    several numerical experiments.

       The layout of the paper is arraged as follows. In
    section 2, we use $4P1-P1$ element to approximate the governing
    equations. Next, the AMG preconditioner for
    Navier-Stokes equations is shown. In Section 4, we give the moving mesh
    strategy briefly. Then we present numerical experiements in section 5. 
    Finaly, we give the conclusions in this section.

   \section{Data structure and weak formulation}
   \label{sec2} At time level discretization, we devide the time
   interval $[0, T]$ into $N$ steps with $\{ t_i\}_{i = 1}^N$. Let
   $\vec{u}^j$ and $p^j$ be the discrete approximation to
   $\vec{u}(\cdot, t_j)$ and $p(\cdot, t_j)$. For simplicity, we
   choose linear backward Euler scheme that linearizing the
   nonlinear term $(\vec{u}^{n + 1} \cdot \nabla) \vec{u}^{n + 1}$
   with $(\vec{u}^n \cdot \nabla) \vec{u}^{n + 1}$.

   In this work, we adopt finite element pair $4P1-P1$,
   which based on two different trianglar meshes and two different
   finite element spaces. By using the hierarchy geometry tree
   (\cite{li2005multi}) structure, velocity mesh can be
   obtained via global refining pressure mesh one time see Figure
   \ref{fig::hgeometry_tree}.

     \label{fig::hgeometry_tree}
   \end{figure}

   The $1-1$ index between velocity elements and pressure elements can
   be obtained without difficulties with the hierarchy geometry tree
   structure. Interested author see \cite{Wu2016moving} for
   details. First some notification are denoted as
   fowllows. $\mathcal{T}_h$ is the grid triangulation
   division for velocity mesh with mesh size $h = max_{T \in
     \mathcal{T}_h} diam(T)$, while $\mathcal{T}_{H}(H = 2h)$ for
   pressure mesh. $X_h \subset (H_0^1(\Omega)^2)$ and
   $P_H \subset \mathcal{L}^2(\Omega)$ are finite-dimentional
   approximation spaces. Then the full discretization is the
   following: given$(\vec{u}_h^n, p_H^n)$ at time $t_n$, to compute
   $(\vec{u}_h^{n + 1}, p_H^{n + 1})$ via 
   \begin{equation}
     \begin{aligned}
       \frac{1}{dt}(\vec{u}_h^{n + 1}, \vec{v}_h) + \nu (\nabla
       \vec{u}_h^{n + 1}, \nabla \vec{v}_h) + (\vec{u}_h^n \cdot
       \nabla \vec{u}_h^{n + 1}, \vec{v}_h) - (p_H^{n + 1}, \nabla
       \vec{v}_h) & = &\frac{1}{dt}(\vec{u}_h^n, \vec{v}) \\
       (\nabla \cdot \vec{u}_h^{n + 1}, q_H) & = & 0. \\
     \end{aligned}
     \label{eq::NS_weak_form}
   \end{equation}
   
   for all $(\vec{v}_h, q_H) \in \mathcal{X}_h \times P_H$.

\section{Fast krylov solver with AMG precondition strategy}
  \label{sec3} Let $\left(\{\phi_j \}_{j = 1}^n, 0 \right)^T$ and
  $\left(0, \{\phi_j\}_{j = 1}^n\right)^T$ be linear basis functions
  for velocity space $X_h$. Meanwhile, $\{\psi_k\}_{k =
    1}^m$ denotes linear basis functions for pressure space
  $P_H$. Then components of velocity solutions
  $\vec{u}_h^{n + 1} = (u_h^{x, n + 1}, u_h^{y, n + 1})^T$ and pressure
  solution $\vec{p}_H^{n + 1}$ at $t = t_{n + 1}$ can be written as 
  \begin{equation}
    u_h^{x, n + 1} = \sum_{j = 1}^{n_u} \alpha_j^{x, n + 1} \phi_j,
    \qquad u_h^{y, n + 1} = \sum_{j = 1}^{n_u} \alpha_j^{y, n + 1}
    \phi_j \qquad p_H^{n + 1} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n_p}\alpha_k^{p, n + 1}
    \psi_k.
    \label{eq::basis_fun}
  \end{equation}
  
  substituting (\ref{eq::basis_fun}) inito weak form
  (\ref{eq::NS_weak_form}), a linear system can be obtained
  
  \begin{equation}
    \left[
      \begin{array}{lll}
        \frac{1}{dt} M + \nu A + N & 0 & B_x^T \\
        0 & \frac{1}{dt} M +\nu A + N  & B_y^T \\
        B_x & B_y & 0
      \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
      \begin{array}{c}
        \alpha^{x, n + 1} \\
        \alpha^{y, n + 1} \\
        \alpha^{p, n + 1}
      \end{array}
    \right] = 
    \left[
      \begin{array}{c}
        f_x \\
        f_y \\
        0
      \end{array}
    \right],
    \label{eq::linear_system}
  \end{equation} 
  Notice that divergence matrix $B = [Bx, By]$ is 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    B_x := [B_x]_{kj} = -\left(\psi_k, \frac{\partial \phi_j}{\partial
        x} \right), k = 1, \cdots, n_p, j = 1, \cdots, n_u, \\
    B_y := [B_y]_{kj} = -\left(\psi_k, \frac{\partial \phi_j}{\partial
        y} \right), k = 1, \cdots, n_p, j = 1, \cdots, n_u.
  \end{eqnarray}
  Assembling of matrix $B$ is a non-trival process due to the
  basis functions of velocity elements and pressure elements are on 
  different mesh. According to the $1-1$ index between velocity
  elements and pressure elements metioned above, we can just use local
  $P1$ element of both velocity and pressure elements to assemble $B$.
  $B^T$ is in the same way.
  
  We denote $F_\nu^{n + 1} = \frac{1}{dt} M + \nu A + N$, where
  \begin{eqnarray}
    M := &[M]_{ij} =& \left( \phi_i, \phi_j \right),\quad  i,j = 1, \cdots,
    n_u, \\
    A := &[A]_{ij} =& \left( \nabla \phi_i, \nabla \phi_j \right), i,j =
    1, \cdots, n_u, \\
    N := &[N]_{ij} =& \left(\vec{u}_h^n, \nabla \phi_i, \phi_j \right),
    i,j = 1, \cdots, n_u.
  \end{eqnarray}
  
  To solve linear system (\ref{eq::linear_system}) efficiently, we 
  use preconditioned GMRES as solver. The block trianglar
  preconditioner $\mathcal{P}$ discussed in \cite{elman2005finite}
  which is defined as following
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P} = 
    \left( 
      \begin{array}{lll}
        F & 0 & B_x^T \\
        0 & F  & B_y^T \\
        0 & 0 & S
      \end{array}
    \right)
  \end{equation}
  where $S = B_xF^{-1}B_x^T + B_yF^{-1}B_y^T$ is the schur complement
  matrix. The action of $\mathcal{P}^{-1}$ is divided into two steps:
  first, solve schur complement system, second, solve two scalar
  systems associated with $F$. It is costly to directly solve schur
  complement system. So in practical computation, the PCD
  preconditioner discussed in \cite{elman2005finite} is used to
  approximate schur complement matrix $S$. PCD preconditioner is
  denoted as $S_* = A_p F_p^{-1} Q_p$, where $A_p, F_p$ and $Q_p$ are
  all on the pressure space. $Q_p$ is mass matrix, $A_p$ is pressure
  diffusion matrix and $F_p$ is convection diffusion matrix denoted as
  \begin{eqnarray}
    F_p := [F_p]_{ij} = \nu (\nabla \psi_i, \nabla \psi_j) +
    (\vec{u}_h^n \cdot \nabla \psi_i, \psi_j), \quad i,j = 1, \cdots, n_p, \\
    A_p := [A_p]_{ij} = (\nabla \psi_i, \nabla \psi_j)\quad i,j = 1, \cdots,
    n_p.
    \label{eq::pcd_mat}
  \end{eqnarray}
  Let $W_p^n := [W_p^n]_{ij} = (\vec{u}_h^n \cdot \nabla \psi_i,
  \psi_j), \quad i,j = 1, \cdots, n_p$, then $F_p$ can be rewitten as
  $F_p = \nu A_p + W_p^n$. We implement PCD preconditioning by 
  \begin{equation}
    S_*^{-1} \approx Q_p^{-1} F_p A_p^{-1}.
  \end{equation}
  Exact PCD preconditioning opearator is denoted as 
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{M}^{-1} = 
    \left(
      \begin{array}{lll}
        F^{-1} & 0 & B_x^T \\
        0 & F^{-1} & B_y^T \\
        0 & 0 &S_*^{-1}
      \end{array}
    \right)
  \end{equation}
  We will explain the $V^d = \mathcal{M}^{-1} V^s$ in two steps,
  where $V^d = (V_x^d, V_y^d, V_p^d)^T, V^s = (V_x^s, V_y^s, V_p^s)^T$.
  Firstly, we solve 
  \begin{equation}
    V_p^d = S_*^{-1} V_p^s = Q_p^{-1} F_p A_p^{-1} V_p^s.
    \label{eq::solve_schur}
  \end{equation}
  It contains two possion problems $Q_p^{-1}$ and $A_p^{-1}$, so we can
  use just an AMG solver for possion equation to solve them.
  Secondly, we use AMG solver to solve 
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      V_x^d = F^{-1} (V_x^s - B_x^T V_p^d), \\
      V_y^d = F^{-1} (V_y^s - B_y^T V_p^d).
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq::solve_velocity}
  \end{equation}
  Combine (\ref{eq::solve_schur}) and (\ref{eq::solve_velocity}), then
  $V^d$ is obtained.

  In practical computation, we use a fixed number of AMG iterations
  (usually one or two) for matrix $F$, $F_p$, $Q_p$, and $A_p$ to
  replace accurate solving, which refers to iterated PCD
  preconditioning. The AMG solver is based on the AFPack(an adaptive
  finite element package), which can be
  obtained from \url{http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~rli}. The efficiency of
  PCD preconditioning is shown in (\cite{elman2005finite},
  Section 10) and \cite{elman2011fast} for bouyancy driven flow
  problem. In our experiements, $F_p$ in (\ref{eq::pcd_mat}) is not so
  efficient as getting rid of $\nu$ in (\ref{eq::pcd_mat}). If without
  explanation, we refer $F_p = A_p + W_p^n$ in this paper. We compare
  the efficiency of two choice of $F_p$ in numerical test below. We
  adopt the method in \cite{elman2009boundary} to deal with matrixes
  $F_p$ and $A_p$ on Neumann boundary for improving efficiency.
  
  In this work, we apply the PCD preconditioning strategy to moving mesh
  finite element method to efficiently solve system
  (\ref{eq::linear_system}). The moving strategy will be shown in next
  section.
 
\section{Moving mesh strategy}
  \subsection{Moving mesh framework}
     \label{sec4} We refer the moving strategy to
     \cite{di2005moving}. In the following, we briefly introduce the
     moving mesh method. At time $t = t_{n}$, we obtain  numerical
     solutions $\vec{u}_h^{(n)}, p_H^{(n)}$ on old 
     mesh $\mathcal{T}_h^n$. We follow the framework in
     \cite{di2005moving} to implement divergence-free 
     interpolation of solutions on $\mathcal{T}_h^n$ to new mesh
     $\mathcal{T}_h^{(n + 1)}$. Briefly speaking, the moving mesh
     strategy mainly contains four steps as follows.
     \begin{enumerate}[step 1]
     \item Obtain monitor function. It is very important to choose an
       appropriate monitor function for adaptive scheme. Let $m = 1/G$,
       where $G$ is the monitor function. As illustrated in
       \cite{di2005moving}, there are some common choices of $G$. One
       based on vorticity is 
       \begin{equation} 
         \centering
         G = \sqrt{1 + \alpha |\omega|^\beta}.
         \label{eq::monitor_vorticity}
       \end{equation}
       where $\omega = \nabla \times \vec{u}$, $\alpha, \beta$
       are positive constants. In this work, $\beta = 2$ performs 
       well, while $\alpha$ is user defined according to different
       problems. 

     \item Get a new logical mesh. Solve elliptic equation 
       \begin{equation}
         \begin{aligned}
           \nabla_{\vec{x}}(m \nabla_{\vec{x}} \vec{\xi}) = 0, \\
           \vec{\xi}|_{\partial \Omega} = \vec{\xi}_b.
         \end{aligned}
         \label{eq::logical}
       \end{equation}
       where $m$ is given in step 1. Then a new logical mesh
       $\mathcal{T}_c^*$ with $\mathcal{A}^*$ as nodes is obtained.

     \item Achieve mesh move direction in physical domain.
       First, After Step 1 and Step 2, we obtain a new logical mesh
       $\mathcal{T}_c^*$ (with $\mathcal{A}^*$ as node). Then we can get
       the difference between $\mathcal{T}_c^*$ and initial logical mesh
       $\mathcal{T}_c^0(with nodes \mathcal{A}^0)$:
       \begin{equation}
         \delta \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}^0 - \mathcal{A}^*.
       \end{equation}
       The displacement $\delta X_i$ in physical domain cen be obtained
       with $\delta \mathcal{A}$. Moreover a positive parameter $\mu$ is multiplied to the 
       displacement $\delta X_i$ in updating old mesh in physical domain
       to a new one: 
       \begin{equation}
         X_i^{(n + 1)} = X_i^{(n)} + \mu \delta X_i.
       \end{equation}
       Intrested readers can see \cite{li2002moving} for mesh
       redistribution in detail.

     \item Preserve divergence-free interpolation.
       It is necessary to keep divergence-free in the interpolation
       when solving incompressible flow with moving mesh finite element
       method. In \cite{di2005moving}, solution re-distribution on the new 
       mesh $\mathcal{T}^{(n + 1)}$ is achieved via solving a lineard inviscid 
       Navier-Stokes-type system as following-char
       \begin{eqnarray}
         \begin{aligned}
           \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial \tau} - \nabla_{\vec{x}}\vec{u}
           \cdot \delta \vec{x} & = & - \nabla \hat{p}, \\
           \nabla_{\vec{x}}\cdot \vec{u} & = & 0.
         \end{aligned}
         \label{eq::continous_update}
       \end{eqnarray} 
       where $\delta \vec{x} := x^{\text{old}} - x^{\text{new}}$ and 
       $x^{\text{old}}, x^{\text{new}}$ are two sets of coordinates in
       physical domain. $\tau$ is a virtual time variable and often
       choosen as $1.0$, because of the convection speed $\delta \vec{x}$
       is relatively small. Here $\hat{p}$ is a temporary variable
       distinguished from the pressure variable in (\ref{eq::NS}). 

       Weak form of (\ref{eq::continous_update}) is : find $(\vec{u}_h,
       \hat{p}_H) \in X_E^h \times P^H$ such that 
       \begin{eqnarray}
         \begin{aligned}
           \left( \partial_{\tau} \vec{u}_h - \nabla_{\vec{x}}\vec{u}_h
           \cdot \delta \vec{x}, \vec{v}_h \right) & = & \left( \hat{p}_H, \nabla
           \vec{v}_h \right), \quad \forall \vec{v}_h \in X_E^h, \\
           \left( \nabla_{\vec{x}} \cdot \vec{u}, q_H\right) & = & 0, \quad \forall
           q_H \in P^H.
         \end{aligned}
         \label{eq::semi_discreted_update}
       \end{eqnarray}
       
       In this work, we use explicit scheme to
       (\ref{eq::semi_discreted_update}) for time discretization:
       \begin{eqnarray}
         \begin{aligned}
           \left ( \frac{\vec{u}_{h, *}^{(n)} - \vec{u}_h^{(n)}}{\delta
               t},
           \vec{v}_h \right) + \left( \delta \vec{x} \cdot \nabla 
           \vec{u}_{h}^{(n)}, \vec{v}_h \right)  & = & \left( 
           \hat{p}_{H, *}^{(n)}, \nabla \vec{v}_h \right), \quad
           \forall \vec{v}_h \in X_E^h. \\
           \left( \nabla \cdot \vec{u}_{h, *}^{n}, q_H \right) & = & 0, \quad
           \forall q_H \in P^H.
         \end{aligned}
         \label{eq::full_discreted_update}
       \end{eqnarray}
       where $\vec{u}_h^{(n)}$ and $p_H^{(n)}$ are the numerical
       solutions of (\ref{eq::NS}) at $t = t_{n}$ using the mesh at
       $t_n$. $\vec{u}_{h,*}^{(n)}$ and $p_{h, *}^{(n)}$ are the
       intermediate updated solutions at $t_{n}$ on the new
       mesh $\mathcal{T}^{(n + 1)}$. 
     \end{enumerate}  

   \subsection{AMG preconditioning strategy for
     (\ref{eq::full_discreted_update}) in solution distribution}
   (\ref{eq::full_discreted_update}) will bring out a linear
   system, whose coefficient matrix $\mathcal{M}^p$ can be denoted as
   \begin{equation}
     \mathcal{M}^p = 
     \left(
       \begin{array}{lll}
         \frac{1}{\delta t} Q_p & 0 & B_x^T \\
         0 & \frac{1}{\delta t} Q_p & B_y^T \\
         B_x & B_y & 0
       \end{array}
     \right)
     \label{mat::moving}
   \end{equation}
   As we known, the schur complement of matrix $\mathcal{M}^p$ is 
   $M_S = B_x Q_p^{-1} B_x^T + B_y Q_p^{-1} B_y^T$. Refering to
   (\cite{elman2005finite}, section 5), for LBB stable mixed
   approximations with enclosed flow boundary conditions, $M_S$ is
   spectral equivalent with pressure Laplacian matrix $A_p$. So we
   use $A_p$ to appropriate schur complement $M_S$. Then we
   choose the block trianglar preconditioner
   \begin{equation}
     \mathcal{K} =
     \left(
       \begin{array}{lll}
         Q_p & 0 & B_x^T \\
         0 & Q_p & B_y^T \\
         0 & 0 & M_S^* 
       \end{array}
     \right)
     \label{eq::updateSolution_precond}
   \end{equation}
   for (\ref{mat::moving}), where $M_S^* = A_p$ or $M_S^* =
   \frac{1}{\nu} A_p$. We will contrast the efficiency of the
   preconditioner by different choice of $M_S^*$.  In our
   practical computation, $\frac{1}{\nu}A_p$ performs more efficiently
   than $A_p$. For inflow/outflow problem, some modifications should
   be given for $A_p$ on Neumann boundary to improve efficiency. Along 
   the outflow boundary $\partial \Omega_N$, the discrete pressure $p_h$
   has to satisfy a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. While
   a Neumann condition $\frac{\partial p_h}{\partial n} = 0$ is
   needed along $\partial \Omega_D$, that means we do nothing on
   $p_h$ along Dirichlet boundary. see \cite{elman2009boundary}
   for detail.
   Note that all the matrixes $M, B_x^T, B_y^T, B_x,
   B_y, A_p$ have to rebuilt once the meshes move. 

   In our algorithm, PCD preconditioned GMRES is selected as a solver
   solving linear system (\ref{eq::linear_system}). We denote the stop
   criterion for GMRES convergence is 
   \begin{equation}
     ||r^{(k)}||  \leq 10^{-6} ||r^{(0)}||
   \end{equation}
   where $r^{(k)}$ is the residual of the linear system
   (\ref{eq::linear_system}) and $r^{0}$ is right hand side of
   (\ref{eq::linear_system}). Finally, to illustrate our algorithm
   clearly, we give the flow-chart as the following algorithm
   \ref{alg::solve}:
   \begin{algorithm}
     \caption{Moving mesh FEM for Navier Stokes equation}

\section{Numerical tests}
      \label{sec5} We use three numerical tests to show our strategy.
      In practical computation, we choose the solutions of steady
      Stokes equations as the initial value of Navier-Stokes
      equations. The initial physical domain
      and logical domain in moving algorithm are the same. Moving mesh
      and numerical solutions are shown in below. Our codes are all
      based on the finite element package AFEPack.

     \subsection{Driven cavity flow}
       We consider the benchmark problem: regularized cavity flow. Our
       computional domain is $\Omega = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and
       viscosity is $\nu = 0.001$. Dirichlet boundary condition is
       imposed on $\partial \Omega$. At the top boundary, $\vec{u} =
       (1 - x^4, 0)^T$ while no-slip boundary condition is setted on
       other parts of $\partial \Omega$.
       
       In our moving strategy, (\ref{eq::monitor_vorticity}) is
       selected as monitor function. Parameters $\alpha = 0.5, \beta =
       2.0$ perform well. The moving mesh and vorticity contour
       evoluting to steady state are shown in Figure
       \ref{fig::cavity_flow_mesh}. It can be seen that mesh clusters
       at top boundary and right boundary where the magnitude of
       vorticity is large. Velocity streamline is shown in Figure
       \ref{fig::cavity_flow_streamline}.
       From Table \ref{tab::GMRES_steps_initial}, it requires less GMRES
       iteration steps by choosing $F_p = A_p + W_p^n$ than $F_p = \nu
       A_p + W_p^n$ in PCD preconditioning. GMRES iteration
       counts of solving linear system (\ref{eq::linear_system}) as
       time evoluting is shown in Figure \ref{fig::cavity_GMRES_steps}.
       It requires $14-24$ iterations to converge, when the flow tends
       to steady state, the number of iterations is $15 - 16$.

   \subsection{Backward step flow}

      This example models the envolution of flow over a backward step.
      The length of the channel is $l = 5$. Poiseuille flow boundary
      condition $\vec{u} = (1 - y^2, 0)^T$is imposed on the inflow
      boundary $x = -1, y \in (0, -1)$. $\vec{u} = (0, 0)^T$ is imposed
      on the top and bottom walls while a natrual condition on the
      outflow boundary $x = 1, y \in (-1, 1)$. We choose viscosity
      $\nu = 0.02$, then the flow tends to steady as $t \rightarrow
      \infty$.
      
      We choose (\ref{eq::monitor_vorticity}) as monitor function
      with parameters $\alpha = 2.0, \beta = 2.0$. Singularities arise
      at the concave corner where flow expanding, so there needs more
      grids. In Figure \ref{fig::step_flow_mesh_streamline}, mesh
      clusters near the concave corner consistent with our assumption. 
      
      Our computational time step length is near $0.008$ which
      satisfing the CFL condition. GMRES iteration counts of solving
      system (\ref{eq::linear_system}) and
      (\ref{eq::full_discreted_update}) via time are shown in
      Figure \ref{fig::GMRES_steps_total}. It requires less than 21
      iteration steps in solving (\ref{eq::linear_system}). 
      It is more efficient by choosing $M_S^* = \frac{1}{\nu} A_p$
      than $M_S^* = A_p$ in (\ref{eq::updateSolution_precond}).

          (\ref{eq::updateSolution_precond}), $\nu = 0.02$}
        \label{fig::GMRES_steps_total}
      \end{figure}

   \subsection{Flow over cylinder}
   
      This example models the development of flow over an cylinder
      along a retangular channel. This problem has been considered in
      \cite{cao1999anr}. The center of cylinder is $(0, 0)$ and the
      radius is $r = 0.3$. Let viscosity $\nu$  equal  $1 / 300$ and
      the domain $\Omega = [-1, 5] \times [-1, 1]$. At the inflow
      boundary $x = -1$, $\vec{u} = (1 - y^2, 0)^T$ with poiseuille
      profile is imposed. On the top and bottom boundary of the
      channel, condition $\vec{u} = (0, 0)^T$ is settled. Natural
      condition is imposed on $x = 5$. 
      
      In our moving strategy, parameters $\alpha$ and
      $\beta$ in (\ref{eq::monitor_vorticity}) are user defined. The
      value of $\alpha$ is greater, the degree of mesh clustering is
      larger. From Figure \ref{fig::cylinder_GMRES_steps}, it can be
      shown that the number of GMRES iteration step with $\alpha = 5$
      is larger than $\alpha = 1.0$. Comparation of GMRES step counts
      between different choice of $F_p$ are shown in Figure 
      \ref{fig::cylinder_GMRES_steps_comparation}, it is found that
      the number of GMRES iteration steps will decrease more than 20 by  
      using $F_p = A + W_p^n$.

      We show the moving mesh at $t = 2s$ in Figure
      \ref{fig::cylinder_mesh_2s}. It can be seen that the mesh obviously
      clusters around the cylinder. As we known, wall street phenomena
      will occur as time evoluting when the flow has an appropriate
      viscosity according to \cite{milton1982album}, just as the mesh
      shown in Figure \ref{fig::cylinder_mesh_40s}.

\section{Remarks}
   \label{sec6} In this work, we apply an efficient AMG
   preconditioning strategy to moving mesh finite elment method based
   on $4P1-P1$ pair. The $4P1-P1$ element pair naturally satisfies the
   inf-sup condition and is linear-order. 
   Linear element is more prefered than high order element in
   practical engeneering computation, according to its simplicity and
   complexities of problems. In our moving strategy, we use the
   monitor function based on vorticity to capture the fine flow
   structure. The structure of mesh is consistent with vorticity
   structure. We compare the number of GMRES iterations of choosing
   different $F_p$ in PCD preconditioning. It is verified that
   modified PCD preconditioning is more efficient by three numerical
   tests. It is discoverd that the number of GMRES iteration step will
   be larger as the mesh becomes clustering. 
   
   We will extend the efficient preconditioning to some intrested 
   problems such as free boundary problem. Also three dimention
   problems of solving incompressible flow with moving mesh finite
   element based on $4P1-P1$ pair will be considered in future work.
